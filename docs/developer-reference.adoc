This document contains information that may be valuable to a developer of PreferencesFX when trying to understand how it works.

== SearchHandler
=== compareMatches()
This method is being used in `SearchHandler`:

[source,java]

----

Changing the search string will filter the categories, groups, and settings into their respective filtered lists, update the amount of matches from the filtered lists and ultimatively calls `setSelectedCategoryByMatch()`.

`compareMatches()` decides from the amount of matches which category should be shown.
 It does this in a way to most optimally reflect what the user, typing into the search field, was looking for.

==== Selection Algorithm
There are 3 types of values which are evaluated:

- the amount of *matches* for *settings*
- the amount of *matches* for *groups*
- the amount of *matches* for *categories*

All three values are compared. The idea behind the algorithm are a few rules:

- a match count of 0 is the least valuable of all possible values
  * if there is no match, it can't be used to show what the user was searching for
- a match count of 1 is the most valuable option
  * if there are 5 matches in categories but only 1 match in settings, it is more likely the user was looking for this exact setting than for one of the categories
- all other values than 0 and 1 are directly compared to each other, while less being better
  * the more specific a match is, the more likely it is what the user is looking for
- if multiple values have the same value, priority will be applied from the most specific to the most general type
  * if there are the same amount of matches for settings and groups, the setting will be chosen
- the displayed category is always the one from the first object in the filtered list
  * if the algorithm decides that *setting* is the most optimal match, it will show the category in which the first setting of the filtered list is in
  * all other settings and groups which match are marked as well, and can be looked through from top to bottom by the user

To visualize the choices, this table shows all possible permutations from 0-3 for each of the three values:
